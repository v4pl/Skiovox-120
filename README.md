"If you see that you don't have a sign in as existing user button, click Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R then click cancel" then continue.

Sign out of your chromebook.

Turn off your wifi.

Select one of the apps

As soon as you click on theÂ app, quickly hit Alt+Shift+S.

This should to launch the toolbar; watch for the "No wifi" screen to appear.

After you click the settings on the screen brightness settings in the tool bar, nothing should happen (the tool bar will disappear), and that's normal.

Press Ctrl+alt+z to open Chrome Vox, then select Resources, then select a link. Now use the exact keybindings to close Chrome Vox.

Entering your password and school account, after click "Sign in as existing user." (Same login for school.)
If everything went well, you should notice "muti user sign in disabled on this Chromebook" and be logged into your school account in the kiosk app. To bypass simply press the ESC button.

You should be able to exit the browser associated with your school account and see a settings option; try turning on wifi first, then close that window. The window that is entirely unblocked is the last one. You can launch incognito as well.
